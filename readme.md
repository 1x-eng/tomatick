## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.15 or higher)
- An account with `mem.ai` and an API token
- Perplexity API token for AI features

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1x-eng/tomatick.git
   ```

2. Navigate to project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tomatick
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. Configure your environment:
   ```env
   POMODORO_DURATION=25m
   SHORT_BREAK_DURATION=5m
   LONG_BREAK_DURATION=15m
   CYCLES_BEFORE_LONGBREAK=4
   MEM_AI_API_TOKEN=your_mem_ai_api_token
   PERPLEXITY_API_TOKEN=your_perplexity_api_token
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

2. Follow the interactive prompts:
   - Provide session context for AI optimization
   - Add tasks or get AI-powered suggestions
   - Complete focused work sessions
   - Reflect on progress and receive AI analysis

3. Review your progress:
   - Session summaries in `mem.ai`
   - AI-powered performance analysis
   - Strategic recommendations for next sessions
